## Overview

The Solar System Simulation project aims to provide an interactive experience for users to explore the Solar System. The simulation includes the instantiation of the Sun, eight planets, solar system animation, space-craft movement, and proper lighting and emission effects.

## Features

- Instantiation of Sun and eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
- Solar system animation with spinning and rotation of planets around the Sun and Moon around Earth.
- Space-craft movement for user exploration.
- Realistic lighting and emission effects.

## Implementation

### Planet Sizes

Planet sizes have been implemented in a sensible manner, providing a realistic representation of each celestial body.

### Planet Colors/Textures

Colors or textures for planets have been chosen sensibly, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and informative visualization.

### Mouse and Keyboard Interaction

User interaction through mouse and keyboard has been implemented to provide an intuitive and immersive experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Solar System Simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mo-ayman/Solar-System-Simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Solar-System-Simulation/src/
   ```

3. Follow the usage instructions below to run the simulation.
